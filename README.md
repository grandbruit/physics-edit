# Physics Edit

A cheap thing to generate JSON physics files for use with Phaser.

## Usage

You need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/). Clone the repository, then install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run it:

```
npm start
```

For now, the image is hard-coded, you can't move points after you created them, and the JSON is printed to the console. ðŸ’©
